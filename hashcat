hashcat steps:
Step 1: Verify Hashcat Installation
    1. Open your terminal in Kali Linux.
    2. Check if Hashcat is installed by running: hashcat --version
    3. If Hashcat is not installed, install it using: sudo apt update && sudo apt install hashcat

Step 2: Create a Sample Hash File
    1. Create a text file containing a hash to crack. For example: echo -n "password" | md5sum > hash.txt or echo -n "password" | md5sum | awk'{print$1}' > hash1.txt 
    2. Open the file to verify the hash: cat hash.txt
Example Output: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99  - This is the MD5 hash of the word "password".
  
Step 3: Perform a Dictionary Attack
    1. Use Hashcat to crack the hash using a wordlist: hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
Explanation:
    • -m 0: Specifies the hash type (MD5 in this case).
    • -a 0: Specifies the attack mode (dictionary attack).
    • hash.txt: The file containing the hash.
    • /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt: The wordlist to use for cracking.
Expected Output: Hashcat will display the cracked password:
5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99:password

Step 4: Perform a Brute-Force Attack
    1. Use Hashcat to perform a brute-force attack: hashcat -m 0 -a 3 hash.txt ?a?a?a?a?a?a
Explanation:
    • -m 0: Hash type (MD5).
    • -a 3: Brute-force attack mode.
    • ?a?a?a?a?a?a: Tries all possible characters for a six-character password.
Expected Output: Hashcat will try all combinations and display the cracked password.
  
Step 5: Cracking NTLM Hashes
    1. Create a file with an NTLM hash (used in Windows systems): echo -n "password" | iconv -f utf-8 -t utf-16le | openssl dgst -md4 > ntlm.txt or awk {print $NF} ntlm.txt > ntlm1.txt
    2. Use Hashcat to crack the NTLM hash: hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 ntlm.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
Expected Output: You should see the cracked NTLM hash and its corresponding password.

Step 6: Resume Cracking (If Interrupted)
    1. If you need to stop the cracking process, press Ctrl+C.
    2. Resume the cracking process using: hashcat --restore
Expected Output: Hashcat will resume from where it left off.
  
Step 7: Save the Cracked Passwords to a File
    1. To save the cracked passwords to a file: hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --outfile cracked_passwords.txt
    2. View the saved file: cat cracked_passwords.txt

Hashcat Tutorial:
1. hashcat -h
2. To see all suppoerted hashtypes: hashcat --examples-hashes
3. To see specfic supported hash: hashcat --examples-hashes | grep -i "sha256"
4. Common modes in hashat are: -m value
-> MD5(0),SHA1(100),SHA256(1400),SHA512(1700),NTLM(Windows)(1000),bcrypt(3200),MTSQL(300),WPA2 (Wifi)(22000)
5. In /usr/share directory: cd wordlist 
touch md5.txt
echo <"hash"> > md5.txt
ls (spot rockyou.txt.gz) if required decompress: gunzip -k rockyou.txt.gz
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 md5.txt rockyou.txt.gz or hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
