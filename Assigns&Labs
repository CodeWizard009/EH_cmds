Nmap 

1. nmap [target]
Example: nmap 192.168.1.1
Performs a basic scan on the target to check the status of commonly used ports. This is the default Nmap scan.

2. nmap -p [ports] [target]
Example: nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.1
Scans only the specified ports on the target instead of the default 1000 ports.

3. nmap -p- [target]
Example: nmap -p- 192.168.1.1
Scans all 65535 ports on the target. Useful for thorough port discovery.

4. nmap -sn [target]
Example: nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
Performs a ping scan to discover live hosts without port scanning.

5. nmap -sV [target]

7. nmap -A [target]
Example: nmap -A 192.168.1.1
Enables aggressive scan: OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

8. nmap -sU [target]
Example: nmap -sU 192.168.1.1
Performs a UDP scan. UDP scanning is slower and used to identify open UDP ports.

9. nmap -sS [target] 
Example: nmap -sS 192.168.1.1
Performs a stealth TCP SYN scan. It’s fast and often undetected by firewalls.

10. nmap -sA [target]

Scans an entire subnet using CIDR notation.

18. nmap -iL [file.txt]
Example: nmap -iL targets.txt
Scans targets listed in a file. Each line should contain a host or subnet.

19. nmap -iR 100
Example: nmap -iR 100
Scans 100 random hosts on the internet.

20. nmap --exclude [IPs]
Example: nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.5,192.168.1.10

25. nmap -T[1-5] [target]

31. nmap -Pn -p 80 [target]
Example: nmap -Pn -p 80 192.168.1.1
Disables host discovery, directly scans port 80 using TCP SYN.

32. TCP Port Scan
Command: nmap -sT [target]
Example: nmap -sT 192.168.1.1
Description:
This is the TCP Connect scan. It completes the full TCP 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and is easily detectable in logs. It's used when you don’t have raw packet privileges (like running Nmap without root/administrator access).

33. UDP Port Scan
Command: nmap -sU [target]
Example: nmap -sU 192.168.1.1
Description:
Scans for open UDP ports. Since UDP doesn’t have handshakes like TCP, it’s harder to detect open ports. Responses or ICMP errors help determine if a port is open or filtered. It’s slower but useful for finding services like DNS, SNMP, and TFTP.

34. TCP SYN Discovery on Port x (default 80)
Command: nmap -PS[x] [target]
Example: nmap -PS80 192.168.1.1
Description:
Sends a SYN packet to the specified port (default is port 80) during host discovery. If a response is received, the host is considered "up." You can specify multiple ports like -PS22,80,443 to improve accuracy.


a. Find the website IP address and scan it using Nmap
Command to find IP: nslookup example.com
Example: nslookup scanme.nmap.org
Then scan using IP: nmap 45.33.32.156

b. Do the version scan on website scanme.nmap.org
Command: nmap -sV scanme.nmap.org
Description: Performs version detection of services running on open ports.

c. Export the output of Nmap command in a text file
Command: nmap scanme.nmap.org -oN output.txt
Description: Saves the normal Nmap output into a text file named output.txt.

d. Export the output of Nmap command in an XML file
Command: nmap scanme.nmap.org -oX output.xml
Description: Saves the output in XML format, useful for parsing with tools.

e. I would like to see the MAC address of the host. Which option to use?
Command: nmap -sn 192.168.1.1
Description: MAC address is shown during host discovery if you're scanning local network and using root/administrator privileges.

f. What is the use of –sP option in Nmap?
Note: -sP is now replaced by -sn.
Use: It performs a ping scan to check which hosts are up, without doing a port scan.

g. What is the use of nslookup command?
Use: It is used to find the IP address of a domain or the domain name from an IP.
Example: nslookup iccs.ac.in

h. Find IP of iccs.ac.in and scan it with Nmap
Find IP: nslookup iccs.ac.in
Example Output: IP = 103.199.14.68
Scan using IP: nmap 103.199.14.68

i. Run Nmap on domain and IP – observe differences
Commands: nmap scanme.nmap.org
nmap 45.33.32.156
Observation:
Usually no difference if domain points directly to that IP. However, some websites use load balancing, so scanning IP directly may not reflect the domain-level protections or hostnames.

j. What is the use of -sA option?
Command: nmap -sA [target]
Use: ACK scan – used to determine firewall rules and if ports are filtered or unfiltered. Does not show open/closed.

k. How to scan only a specific port?
Command: nmap -p 80 scanme.nmap.org
Scans only port 80.

l. Can I scan two port numbers at a time? How?
Yes!
nmap -p 22,443 scanme.nmap.org
Scans both ports 22 and 443.

m. What is the use of -sL option?
Command: nmap -sL 192.168.1.0/24

Use: Performs a list scan – lists all targets that would be scanned, but does not send any packets.

n. How to list down only the targets without scanning them?
Command: nmap -sL [target]
Example: nmap -sL google.com
Use:Only lists the resolved IPs or hosts, no scanning.

o. What is the use of -sn option?
Command: nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
Use: Ping scan (host discovery only). Checks which hosts are online, but doesn’t scan any ports.
